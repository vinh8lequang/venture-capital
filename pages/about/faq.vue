                <v-card-title class="text-caption text-md-h5 font-weight-light">Who should I reach out to?</v-card-title>
                <p>Our partner profiles can help you learn more about them and areas of interest, but the short answer is that you don’t need to worry about connecting with the “right” partner. We share our networks and expertise and we will always route opportunities to whoever is the best fit. When you drop one of us a line, you drop all of us a line.</p>
                <v-card-title class="text-caption text-md-h5 font-weight-light">What is hardtech?</v-card-title>
                <p>Solving a hard technological problem using an interdisciplinary mix of technology and engineering. Hardtech startups face technological risk in their early days and need patient and supportive capital to help them go through R&D cycles. HCVC exists to bring this type of capital to the most ambitious hardtech founders.</p>
                <v-card-title class="text-caption text-md-h5 font-weight-light">What is HEP’s Investment Thesis?</v-card-title>
                <p>We invest in early-stage companies that automate and digitize the physical world. We partner with companies building software- or hardware-based products (or a combination of both) as long as they are able to create long-term competitive advantages through technical defensibility. Members of Horizon Equity Partners alumni are our first source of new investments, but we also invest in companies outside of HEP.</p>
                <v-card-title class="text-caption text-md-h5 font-weight-light">Does HEP invest globally?</v-card-title>
                <p>Yes, we are excited to meet talented founders everywhere in the world.</p>
                <v-card-title  class="text-caption text-md-h5 font-weight-light">How do I seek investment from HCVHEP?</v-card-title>
                <p>You should first apply to Horizon Equity Partners. The best way for us to get to know you is to evaluate you as a member of our community. You will have a better chance of being noticed when you’re raising money if you are already a member of HEP.</p>
                <p>Our process of evaluating companies for investment begins with the same conversation we would have with you as a prospective member of Hardware Club. We may have multiple conversations with you and introduce you to different people at HEP. If these conversations go well, we will schedule a partner meeting, where all our partners get to know you better.</p>
                <p>In the partner meeting, we will ask you to put together a short deck to present for 15-20 minutes followed by 25-30 minutes of questions. We like to keep these meetings focused on short, data-driven discussion.</p>
                <p>We debrief during our regular team meetings. Because we are thorough, sometimes it can take us a few weeks to make a decision. Please be patient.</p>
